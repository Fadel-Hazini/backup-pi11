== Rocky 8 Raspberry Pi Image (experimental) ==

This is a minimal Rocky 8 install intended for Raspberry Pi 4 devices (architecture is aarch64).

It may work on a Pi 3 , but that has not been tested.  We are looking for Rpi 3 owners to test if you'd like to try it.

This image WILL NOT WORK on a Raspberry Pi 1 or 2, we are 64-bit only, and have no support for 32-bit ARM processors.  Sorry :-/.

  - Based on Rocky Linux 8.4, points to production Rocky 8 aarch64 repositories
  - Has an additional repository that contains kernel packages for Raspberry Pi
  - Includes script that fixes the wifi.  Simple edit of a txt firmware settings file.  Will need to be run whenever linux-firmware gets upgraded
  - Includes @minimal-install , plus a few quality of life packages like vim, bash-completion, etc.

It should fill your main rootfs partition to the end of the disk.
